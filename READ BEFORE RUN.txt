HOW TO PLAY
===========
simply click on a starting country, you will be greeted
with a map and red and green dots, these dots represent
cities. The green is you and the red is the AI.

To fire missiles you need to select a city and then select
the target city to launch. There is a button you can click
at the bottom to switch from "Regular" to "ICBM", the ICBM
missiles can destroy a city in one hit but might not always
land. The Regular missiles takes 1 health away from the city
but has a better chance of landing. Each city has a total of 
3 ICBM missiles to use.

Each city has a health of 3, so 3 hits with a regular will
wipe out that city.
